* How many employees?

-----------------------------

The amount of employees will determine how many times these questions will be asked: 

* What is your name?

* What is your position
-Manager
-Engineer
-Intern

* What is your ID number?

* What is your email?

 if(Your position==Manager){

- What college did you go to?
}

~  repeat questions based off of how many employees starting at 'name' question

After the questions are answered, cards are then populated with information based off of the representative questions answered for each employee.



## Conclusion

This assignment was really interesting for me; I really enjoyed building code based off of a test driven environment. I can see how effective this way of coding can be for writing out lines of code; it felt like a more efficient process of following pseudo code when it came to applying solutions to problems in the code. This project also made me more comfortable about working with CLI's; applying information from a commandline to my javascript felt so surreal to me a couple weeks ago, but I am definitely more confindent with the process now. I think what will make my project stand out for this assignment would probably be how clean and smooth my prompt process is in my CLI!
